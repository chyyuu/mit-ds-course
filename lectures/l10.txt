===================
3/12/13

consistency model

treadmarks solvers
  false sharing -- two writes on the same page
  write application - one byte write
  
write diffs

Next goal: allow multiple writable copies

release consistency (RC)

acquire(l)
  x=s'
release(l)  -->broadcast write diff on release to all copies of page(S)
  

lazy release consistency

the improtant part is tell the implementation and the demo/examplify the process

Rules
-----
  1. every var protected
  2. must lock  around write
  3. must lock  around read(if you want to see the fresh data)

===================
Today:
  Lazy release consistency
  TreadMarks
  Contrast to IVY and sequential consistency

Labs 4+5 implement a form of RC; not lazy like TreadMarks
  
Review: what makes a good consistency model?
  Model is a contract between memory system and programmer
    Programmer follows some rules about reads and writes
    Model provides guarantees
  Model embodies a tradeoff
    Intuitive for programmer
    vs.
    Can be implemented efficiently

Treadmarks high level goals?
  Better DSM performance.
  Run existing parallel code.

What specific problems with previous DSM are they trying to fix?
  false sharing: two machines use diff vars on same page, at least one writes
    IVY => page bounces back and forth
    but doesn't need to if different vars
  send only written bytes -- not whole pages

Big idea: write diffs
  goal: don't send whole page, just written bytes
  on M1 write fault:
    tell other hosts to invalidate but keep hidden copy
    M1 makes hidden copy as well
  on M2 fault:
    M2 asks M1 for recent modifications
    M1 "diffs" current page against hidden copy
    M1 send diffs to M2
    M2 applies diffs to its hidden copy

Next goal: allow multiple readers+writers
  to cope with false sharing
  => no invalidation when a machine writes
  => no r/w -> r/o demotion when a machines reads
  => multiple *different* copies of a page!
     which should a reader look at?
  diffs help: can merge writes to same page
  but when to send the diffs?
    no invalidations -> no page faults -> what triggers sending diffs?

Big idea: release consistency
  no-one should read data w/o holding a lock!
    so let's assume a lock server, much like in lab
  send out write diffs on release, to all copies of pages written
  this is a new consistency model!
    M0 won't see M1's writes until M1 releases a lock
    so machines can temporarily disagree on memory contents
    if you always lock:
      locks force order -> no stale reads -> like sequential consistency
    if you don't lock:
      reads can return stale data
      concurrent writes to same var -> trouble
  benefit?
    multiple machines can have copies of a page, even when 1 or more writes
    => no bouncing of pages due to false sharing
    => read copies can co-exist with writers
  relies on write diffs
    otherwise can't reconcile concurrent writes to same page

Big idea: lazy release consistency
  only fetch write diffs on acquire of a lock
    only fetch from previous holder of that lock
  i.e., nothing happens at time of write or release
  LRC is yet another new consistency model!
    LRC hides some writes that RC reveals (example below)
  benefit?
    if you don't acquire lock on object, you don't have to fetch updates to it
    => if you use just some vars on a page, no need to fetch writes to others
    => less network traffic

Example 1 (false sharing)
x and y are on the same page.
M0: a1 for(...) x++ r1
M1: a2 for(...) y++ r2  a1 print x, y r1
What does IVY do?
What does Treadmarks do?
  M0 and M1 both get cached writeable copy of the page
  when they release, each computes diffs against original page
  M1's a1 causes it to pull write diffs from last holder of lock 1
    so M1 updates x in its page

Example 2 (LRC)
x and y on same page (otherwise IVY avoids copy too)
M0: a1 x=1 r1
M1:           a2 y=1 r2
M2                      a1 print x r1
What does IVY do?
What does Treadmarks do?
  M2 only asks previous holder of lock 1 for write diffs
  M2 does not see M1's modification to y, even tho on same page

Q: is LRC a win over IVY if each variable on a separate page? (no)

Q: why is LRC a reasonably intuitive model for programmers?
   same as sequential consistency if you always lock
   but non-locking code, like v=f(); done=1; does not work

Example 3 (motivate vector timestamps)
M0: a1 x=1 r1
M1:             a1 a2 y=x r2 r1
M2:                             a2 print x, y r2
What's the "right" answer?
  we need to define what LRC guarantees!
  answer: when you acquire a lock,
    you see all writes by previous holder
    and all writes previous holder saw 
What does TreadMarks do?
  M2 and M1 need to decide what M2 needs and doesn't already have
  uses "vector timestamps"
  each machine numbers its releases (i.e. write diffs)
  M1 tells M2:
    at release, had seen M0's writes through #20, &c
    0: 20
    1: 25
    2: 19
    3: 36
    ...
    this is a "vector timestamp"
  M2 remembers a vector timestamp of writes it has seen
  M2 compares w/ M1's VT to see what writes it needs from other machines

More on VTs next lecture...

VTs order writes to same variable by different machines:
M0: a1 x=1 r1  a2 y=9 r2
M1:              a1 x=2 r1
M2:                           a1 a2 z = x + y r2 r1
M2 is going to hear "x=1" from M0, and "x=2" from M1.
  How does M2 know what to do?

Could the VTs for two values of the same variable not be ordered?
M0: a1 x=1 r1
M1:              a2 x=2 r2
M2:                           a1 a2 print x r2 r1

Programmer rules / system guarantees?
  1. programmer must lock around all writes to shared variables
     to order writes to same var
     otherwise "latest value" not well defined
  2. to read latest value, must lock
  3. if no lock for read, guaranteed to see values that
     contributed to the variables you did lock

Example of when LRC might work too hard.
M0: a2 z=99 r2  a1 x=1 r1
M1:                            a1 y=x r1
TreadMarks will send z to M1, because it comes before x=1 in VT order.
  Assuming x and z are on the same page.
  Even if on different pages, M1 must invalidate z's page.
But M1 doesn't use z.
How could a system understand that z isn't needed?
  Require locking of all data you read
  => Relax the causal part of the LRC model

Q: could TreadMarks work without using VM page protection?
   it uses VM to
     detect writes to avoid making hidden copies (for diffs) if not needed
     detect reads to pages => know whether to fetch a diff
   neither is really crucial
   so TM doesn't depend on VM as much as IVY does
     IVY used VM faults to decide what data has to be moved, and when
     TM uses acquire()/release() and diffs for that purpose

Performance?

Figure 3 shows mostly good scaling
  is that the same as "good"?
  though apparently Water does lots of locking / sharing

How close are they to best possible performance?
  maybe Figure 5 implies there is only about 20% fat to be cut

Does LRC beat previous DSM schemes?
  they only compare against their own straw-man ERC
    not against best known prior work
  Figure 9 suggests not much win, even for Water

Has DSM been successful?
  clusters of cooperating machines are hugely successful
  DSM not so much
    main justification is transparency for existing threaded code
    that's not interesting for new apps
    and transparency makes it hard to get high performance
  MapReduce or message-passing or shared storage more common than DSM
