=================================================
Consistency so far
  Concurrency forces us to to think about meaning of reads/writes
  Sequential consistency: everyone sees same read/write order (IVY)
  Release consistency: everyone sees writes in unlock order (TreadMarks)

Sequential and release consistency are slow:
  in general, must ask before each operation
  IVY: read faults and write faults -> ask manager
  TreadMarks: acquire and release -> ask lock manager
  Can we get better performance by weakening consistency?

Optimistic Concurrency Control
  Do the operation now (e.g., read/write cached copy)
  Check if it was OK later
  Recover if not OK

A simple example -- optimistic peer-to-peer chat
  We each have a computer attached to internet
  When I type something, send msg to each participant
  Recv msg -> add to end of chat window

Do we care about message ordering for chat?
  Network may deliver in different order at different participants
  Joe: The answer is 40
  Fred: No, it's 41
  Alice: That's correct
  Maybe Sam sees different order:
    Joe: 40
    Alice: That's correct

What went wrong in this example?
  Alice "computed" her message based on certain inputs
  Sam can only interpret if he has seen those inputs too

Definition: x causally precedes y
  Joe does x, then Joe does y, or
  Joe does x, Joe sends msg to Fred, Fred does y, or
  transitive closure of above

Definition: causal consistency
  if x causally precedes y, everyone sees x before y

Slow implementation of causal consistency
  Unique ID for every msg
  Node keeps set of all msg IDs received -- "history"
  When sending m, send current history set, too
  Receiver delays incoming msg m until has received everything in m's set

History sets will grow huge -- can we abbreviate?
  Each node numbers its msgs 1, 2, 3, &c
  Somehow ensure in-order delivery from each node (easy of numbered)
  Then history need only include latest # seen from each node
    H1/4 implies saw 1, 2, 3 also
  This notation doesn't grow over time, unlike history sets
  Formalized as Vector Timestamp

Vector Timestamp (as in TreadMarks):
  Each node numbers its own actions (sent msgs, in this case)
  VT is a vector of numbers, one slot per node
  Each message sent out with a VT
  VT[i]=x => sender had seen all msgs from node i up through #x

VT comparisons
  to answer "should msg A be displayed before msg B?"
  four situations: a < b, a > b, a = b, a || b
  a < b if a[i] <= b[i] for all i, and a[j] < b[j] for some j
  a || b if a[i] < b[i] and a[j] > b[j], for some i,j
    i.e. neither came before the other

CBCAST -- "causal broadcast" protocol
  [diagram: node, msg buf, VC, chat app]
  Just what we need for peer-to-peer chat
  From Cornell Isis research project
  Each node keeps a local VT called vector clock, VC
  When node i sends msg m:
    increment VC[i]
    send m with VC
  Received messages buffered but maybe not processed (displayed, for chat)
  Process m from i only if m's VT <= VC, except VT[i] = VC[i] + 1
    i.e. local node has seen every msg that causally precedes m
    Update VC: VC[i] = max(VC[i], VT[i])
    Subsequent sent msgs will reflect receipt of m (+ causally preceding msgs)

Example:
  All VCs start <0,0,0>
  M0 sends <1,0,0>
  M1 receives <1,0,0>
  M1 sends <1,1,0>
  M2 receives <1,1,0> -- must delay
  M2 receives <1,0,0> -- can process, unblocks other msg

Why faster then sequential consistency?
  M0 sends <1,0>
  M1 sends <0,1>
  M0 and M1 are allowed to disagree on order!
  No global order => no central (slow) IVY MGR

Causal consistency still allows more surprises than sequential
  Sam can still see:
    Joe: 40
    Fred: 41
    Bob: 42
    Alice: That's correct
  So programmers have to be more careful

Why not implement sequential consistency in an optimistic way?
  That is, fire off msgs whenever, and check sequentiality on receipt?
  Checking a trace for sequentiality is NP-complete
  Even though generating one (as IVY does) is simple
  Thus optimism+causality is common in distributed systems

TreadMarks uses VTs -- for what?
  M0: a1 x=1 r1
  M1:             a1 a2 y=x r2 r1
  M2:                             a2 print x, y r2
  What's the "right" answer?
    we need to define what LRC guarantees!
    answer: when you acquire a lock,
      you see all writes by previous holder
      and all writes previous holder saw 
  What does TreadMarks do?
    M2 and M1 need to decide what M2 needs and doesn't already have
    TM uses VTs to count acquires/releases
    On M2's acquire, M1 sends its VC to M2
    M2 subtracts to see what M1 knew that M2 didn't
    M2 knows to ask M0 for x=1

TM also uses VTs to order writes to same variable by different machines:
  M0: a1 x=1 r1  a2 y=9 r2
  M1:              a1 x=2 r1
  M2:                           a1 a2 z = x + y r2 r1
  M2 is going to hear "x=1" from M0, and "x=2" from M1.
    How does M2 know what to do?

VTs are often used for optimistic updating of replicated data
  Everyone has a copy, anyone can write
  Don't want IVY-style MGR or locking: network delays, failures
  Need to sync replicas, accept only "newest" data, detect conflicts
  File sync (Tra, Ficus, Coda, Rumor)
  Distributed DBs (Amazon Dynamo, Voldemort, Riak)

File synchronization
  Multiple computers have a copy of all files
  Each can modify its local copy
  Merge changes later -- optimistic

Scenario:
  user has files replicated at work, at home, on laptop
  hosts may be off, on airplane, &c -- not always on Internet
  work on H1 for a while, sync changes to H2
  work on H2, sync changes to H3
  work on H3, sync to H1
  overall goal: push changes around to keep machines identical

Example 1:
  Focus on a single file
  H1: f=1 ->H2       ->H3
  H2:            f=2
  H3:                       ->H2
  What is the right thing to do?
  Is it enough to simply take file with latest modification time?
  Yes in this case, as long as you carry them along correctly.
    I.e. H3 remembers mtime assigned by H1, not mtime of sync.

Example 2:
  H1: f=1 ->H2 f=2
  H2:                  f=0 ->H1
  H2's mtime will be bigger.
  Should the file synchronizer use "0" and discard "2"?
    No! They were conflicting changes. We need to detect this case.
    Modification times are not enough by themselves

Big goal: No Lost Updates
  Only OK for sync to copy version x2 over version x1 if
    x2 includes all updates that are in x1.

What if there were concurrent updates?
  So that neither version includes the other's updates?
  Copying would then lose one of the updates
  So sync doesn't copy, declares a "conflict"
  Conflicts are a necessary consequence of optimistic writes

How to decide if one version contains all of another's updates?
  We could record each file's entire modification history.
  List of hostname/localtime pairs.
  And carry history along when synchronizing between hosts.
  For example 1:   H2: H1/T1,H2/T2   H3: H1/T1
  For example 2:   H1: H1/T1,H1/T2   H2: H1/T1,H2/T3
  Then its easy to decide if version X supersedes version Y:
    If Y's history is a prefix of X's history.

We can use VTs to compress these histories!
  One VT per file
  Number each host's writes to a file (or assign wall-clock times)
  Just remember # of last write from each host
  VT[i]=x => file version includes all of host i's updates through #x

VTs for Example 1:
  After H1's change: v1=<1,0,0>
  After H2's change: v2=<1,1,0>
  v2 > v1, so H1 accept's H2's copy
  v1 < v2, so H1 ignores H3's copy (no conflict since <)

VTs for Example 2:
  After H1's first change: v1=<1,0,0>
  After H1's second change: v2=<2,0,0>
  After H2's change: v3=<1,1,0>
  v3 neither < nor > v1
    thus neither has seen all the other's updates
    thus there's a conflict

What if there *are* conflicting updates?
  VTs can detect them, but then what?
  Depends on the application.
  Easy: mailbox file with distinct messages, just union.
  Medium: changes to different lines of a C source file (diff+patch).
  Hard: changes to the same line of C source.
  Reconciliation must be done manually for the hard cases.

What about file deletion?
  Can H1 just forget a file's VT if it deletes the file?
    No: when H1 syncs w/ H2, it will look like H2 has a new file.
  H1 must remember deleted files and their VTs.
  Treat delete like a file modification.
    H1: f=1  ->H2 
    H2:           del  ->H1
    second sync sees H1:<1,0> H2<1,1>, so delete wins at H1
  There can be delete/write conflicts
    H1: f=1  ->H2  f=2
    H2:            del  ->H1
    H1:<2,0> vs H2:<1,1> -- conflict

How to delete the VTs of deleted files?

Is it enough to wait until all hosts have seen the delete msg?
  Sync would carry, for deleted files, set of hosts who have seen del
  Turns out not to work:
    H1 sees everyone has seen del, forgets about VT
    H1 syncs w/ H2, which doesn't yet know everyone knows
    For all H2 knows, some H3 hasn't seen del, might send file to H1
    So H2 must tell H1 about file, del, and VT

Working VT GC scheme from Ficus replicated file system
  Phase 1: accumulate set of nodes that have seen delete
    terminates when == complete set of nodes
  Phase 2: accumulate set of nodes that have completed Phase 1
    when == all nodes, can totally forget the file
  If H1 then syncs against H2,
    H2 must be in Phase 2, or completed Phase 2
    if in Phase 2, H2 knows H1 once saw the delete, so need not tell H1 abt file
    if H2 has completed Phase 2, it doesn't know about the file either

A classic problem with VTs:
  Many hosts -> big VTs
  Easy for VT to be bigger than the data!
  No very satisfying solution

Many file synchronizers don't use VTs -- e.g. Unison, rsync
  File modification times enough if only two parties, or star
  Need to remember "modified since last sync"
  VTs needed if you want any-to-any sync with > 2 hosts

Summary
  Replication + optimistic updates for speed, fault tolerance
  Causal consistency yields reasonably sane order of optimistic updates
  Vector Timestamps a cheap implementation of causality / defn of "newest"

Optimistic Replication Using Vector Time Pairs
Russ Cox and William Josephson

what's the overall goal?
  fast + flexible file sync

specific problems w/ existing file synchronizers? e.g. Ficus/Rumor
  must exchange VT for every file during sync
  must store VT for every file
  must store VT for every deleted file
  (note VTs can be big if many hosts involved)

what's the key idea?
  two vector times: mod time (mt) and sync time (st)
  what you have vs what you know

sync time
  each file has a sync time
  when H1 syncs to H2
    sync times of files set of elementwise max
  VT[i] is wall-clock time, not a count of events

sync time example for one file
      1     2     3     4
  H1: f=1  ->H2  ->H3
  H2:                  ->H3
  H3:
  when H2 syncs to H3:
    file mt at H2 is <1,0,0>
    file st at H3 is <3,0,0>
  thus H3 knows it has synced since last file change
  so far, not a win over single VT per file

usually you're syncing lots of files
  common case: almost all files are up to date
    syncs usually only xfer a few files
  how to detect "no sync required" w/o exchanging all files' VTs?
  if all H2's files have been synced since H1's most recent change,
    don't need to copy anything from H1 to H2
  so H2 needs min(st), H1 needs max(mt)

Tra uses this observation for each directory
  dir mt = elementwise max over all descendents' mt
  dir st = elementwise max over all descendents' st

Example:
  H1 and H2 sync at time 5
    all H2 files' st set to <5,5>
    so H2 dir st = <5,5>
  H1 and H2 sync again at time 6
    no recent changes, so H1 dir mt = <1,0>
    so quick compare shows H1 dir mt < H2 dir st
  one file changed on H1
    so H1 dir mt=<7,0>, H2 dir st = <6,6>
  sync at time 8
    H1 mt=<7,0> !<= H2 st=<6,6>
    so they must compare per-file VTs

does dir sync/mod sound like an important optimization?
  yes, for big directories
  millions of files -> vast VT traffic
  Tra can reduce that to a just two VTs
  I have this problem!

why couldn't we do this w/ single VT?
  e.g. compare H1's max(file VTs) vs H2's min(file VTs)
  max(file VTs) is a good conservative estimate of latest update
  but min(file VTs) is likely to be <0,0,...>
    it has to be elementwise (min not generally defined on VTs)
    and there will usually be some file that wasn't modified on each host
  result: it will always seem like there is new information

how does Tra handle deletion?
  does not have delete notices; host just deletes the file and its VTs
  dir sync time proves no file existed as of that time!!!
  during sync
    if other file mt < dir st, he should delete
    if other file mt > dir st?
      delete/write conflict?
      or new file?
      look at file creation time vs st to decide
